## Briefing
At Auth0 we believe in providing drop-in solutions to our customers. Our current Lock widget is a clear example that encapsulates the whole signin/signup experience.

We want to take this approach to other parts of our service, starting with the editing the user profile experience. App developers should have a simple way to allow their app users to edit information about them.

Here is an example of such a thing:

The goal of this exercise is to develop a usersâ€™ Profile Widget that consumes our API v2.

## Objectives
The expected result of the exercise is a working example of a Profile Widget component:

### Requirements
- A developer should be able to initialize the widget bound to a user profile and it should work.
- The example should be publicly accessible. You can use github or gitlab pages, heroku, zeit now or whatever you want.
- Usage and API documentation of the widget should be present.

### Optional
- Ability to provide default values if one does not exist.
- Ability to transform values before displaying them and when saving them.
- Ability to validate field values.
- Displaying nice errors in the UI

## Goals
These are the main skills we assess in this exercise:
- Coding skills
- Research ability
- Written communication
- Autonomy
- Expectation management and interaction with us
- Attention to details
- Customer orientation

Please, while you are doing the exercise, track the effort you invest in the exercise. We know that you are not dedicated to this full-time, so it's useful for us to understand the time you spent on tasks.

The idea is to iterate over it, so you can get an idea of the way we work and we can get an idea of how you work, based on a real life task.

We aim to do the demo or on before August 16th. If you believe it will take you longer, please let us know and we can see how to best approach the situation.
